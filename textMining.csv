Hearing someone interviewing for the same position telling me how much coding practice they've done doesn't help either.

Every night when I fall asleep I have bad dreams about being rejected from jobs, sitting in a midterm and unable to do anything, or being required to withdraw from school. When I wake up, I face the reality of being behind in all my courses, as well as my inability to do interviews. I am not good at anything.

me being the socially anxious dweeb I am didn't want to go out and turn it off while they were there so I ended up burning the food and setting off the fire alarm -- my roomate then started panicking and bolted to the alarm with a piece of cloth to try and fan the smoke away from the alarm and literally knocked his own friend over in the process.

,1,Competition,Competition,"Honest question for those who'd consider themselves in the same boat.. How do you deal with being mediocre?

I am in my upper years in CS. I would say most of the people I hang out with stand out, they have exceptional academic performance or a very strong employment record filled with highly sought-after positions. When talking or working on a problem with them they display sharp reasoning and a degree of logical consistency I can't keep up with. I manage to get by, but my grades are shit and my co-op record is unremarkable, and it is really difficult to not hate myself. I know it should be expected at a good university that there will be (maybe many) people who eclipse you, but I've been here for a number of years and I still don't know how I should see myself in light of that.

How do others deal with this? I know that many people are in the same boat performance-wise but I have no idea how they might maintain a healthy self-image. I feel overwhelming inferiority for not being at the top and I often feel there is no point to even existing when there are many others who can do what I can do but better. How are other people able to accept themselves in spite of their limitations?",,,
,1,Competition,Interview,"Ugh, I keep blanking or fumbling around during technical interviews or questions, and it's really bothering me.. I'm pretty sure I'm capable of answering these questions too, because as soon as I leave the interview or the coding challenge ends, I know what I needed to do to get an optimal solution (if I didn't manage an optimal solution). Sometimes I'm on it, but then it seems like the other interviewees are also.. I just can't seem to focus very well at the task at hand in an interview situation. I guess the only option is to keep on practicing and do more questions, and not treat each interview as a ""do or die"" sort of thing.

But yeah, the smallest things can throw me off. For one company, I walked in expecting to be able to choose C++, but they had a laptop with a Java IDE on it, and although the question was fairly straightforward, I was so irked by the fact that I had to use Java that it took a while for me to get the solution they were looking for. The interviewer refused to clarify things and just sat there watching me type, so not sure exactly what they were looking for, cause it felt like talking to a wall.. inb4 culture fit",,,
,1,Competition,Competition,"WARNING: Long read, sorry. Felt like I needed to get this out because I relate to this so very much.

Are you me? I'm also a biol student (assuming from your name) who's having a similar experience - didn't get a co-op job the first term, and just scraped by with getting a last minute 8-month co-op the next term which also offset me from the other students on the co-op stream leaving me with little choice in courses to take. I study long hours, but never do as good as my peers who spend far less time studying to the point that I feel like I have a learning impediment as I cannot for the life of me remember information. 

Things were steadily spiraling downhill for me as I got to the point where I was barely getting 50's/failing midterms. I also had chem 266 and completely failed the second midterm (I got like 3/12). I kid you not - one look at the midterm and I actually laughed bitterly to myself as soon as I read the first sentence as it literally looked like a foreign language to me. 

Things surely enough got to a point where it became a regular thing to cry when I was alone and isolate myself from others as I felt like everyone was in a different world from me. 

But... I found the smallest of all hopes in myself. Despite miserably failing several midterms, I still managed to pass the courses and I am slowly improving myself - and I know you can do the same (albeit, my grades are not something to be particularly proud about). I had to stop and ask myself: how I can change?

A lot of people told me that you shouldn't be in a rush to graduate and I think it is something important to consider. If you think you are unable to handle a certain course load, do not hesitate to drop. Friends are taking 5 courses while you are taking 3? Take a moment to stop and consider only yourself. Take a course load that you are confident you can handle. There is NO rush to graduate especially when you don't have a particular career path in mind. Take the time to learn things at your own pace.

I also started reaching out for help. I decided that I would go to counselling services last term for advice on how to cope with my problems. They provided a good pillar of support and prescribed me medication. I am also currently still in the process of being diagnosed with depression/ADHD. Don't take this the wrong way - I know medication doesn't sound like a particularly good idea to use to get around things, but they have actually helped me considerably. One particular medication I was prescribed with tackled anxiety and it literally did wonders for me when I took it during exam period. I also opened up to a friend and my family about my situation and to my surprise, they supported me and it is one of the main things that keep me going. If you don't have anyone, you can hit me up with a PM and we can meet up/chat if you need someone to talk to (warning though: I'm pretty awkward lol).

Another thing. Dropping out of co-op does not mean it is the end of the world. There are lots of people I know who dropped out of co-op especially since we have it rough in the job market in our program. Don't sweat it, there will always be opportunities outside of co-op to develop experience. 

Make changes to your daily schedule to accommodate when you learn best and plan ahead. I have a tendency to fall asleep during the afternoon and so I have moved my study times to evenings and nights. I also need to emphasize that you should always make sure to get enough sleep. There was an exam where I pulled an allnighter for and I literally blanked out for half of it which destroyed my final grade. It seriously affects your memory and anxiety levels. 

Lastly, learn to understand that it's okay to fail. Don't punish yourself - it only makes things worse. Let go of those regrets and learn to understand that you have tried your best - a feat that is admirable in itself. Finding confidence in yourself is key to moving on. Reward yourself for the little differences you make. Bit by bit you can rebuild yourself and it all begins by changing your negative outlook. You can do it, I believe in you. 

That's how I'm coping with things right now. I'm doing a little better now.

My course load is this (just 4 courses):
Stat 330, CS 371, Stat 333, Math 239.

I'm already getting buttblasted by Math 239 and stat 333, but a small part of me wants to keep going so that I can get these courses over with. But a significant part of me wants to run away from it all.

I feel all alone.

I've always been used to being on my own for the past few years now.  It's never been much of a bother to me since I enjoy and am used to spending time on my own.  I'm currently on my work term and things have been going well.  I've been able to learn and dp work that I enjoy while making strides in impressing my coworkers.  I have a few good friends that I occasionally meet up and talk with (bit hard to now since we're all busy with our work terms and personal lives in different cities).  

But right now I just feel alone and emotional.  

I've met new people and have had many experiences.  I'm doing well at my company (things could be better academically, but they're decent nonetheless).  I have great friends that I'm glad I've been able to meet and get to know.

But despite all of this I feel like I have no one to talk to.  I've always felt like I was second fiddle to everyone.  I feel like I've never been worth anyone's time but I know that's not true as people have busy lives and my friends care about me as much as I do them.  I feel like I haven't really changed while everyone around me has been able to be comfortable with themselves and grow as people.

I've never been in love and feel so fucking undeserving of anyone.  I know I shouldn't feel this way but fuck I just wish I could open up to someone without being disgusted with myself.

how can i learn about tax for working in us as canadian citizen ?  i do not understand what exemptions are (is that like the basic personal deductible in canada ?) but it seems so small (like only 4k ?  but we can claim 2 so it is 8k ?).  is it better to just use this or to do 'itemized' (like in canada ?)

if this is all you can deduct how do people say tax is higher in canada when us tiers are actually even higher ??

if i have 160k taxable income, how much will i be able to keep ?

,1,,,"I've been feeling pretty shit lately and don't know what to do. I've been depressed for a while but its gotten worse ever since I got here. At first I was proud to be at one of Canada's most prestigious university's but soon after classes began I realized that I was well below the norm of my class and wasn't even close to being equal to my peers.  Midterms came around and I got wrecked to say the least. I did manage to pass them all but I was extremely close to failing most of them despite most of the material being high school review. I studied a lot for circuits, physics and chemistry and did awful in all which was just straight demoralizing especially since everyone around me got high 80s. I've been studying hard for finals now but I haven't actually understood anything I've studied and I feel like I'm going to be screwed. I don't even think I like my program. I'm in ECE and its just been killing my soul already. I don't even know wtf I'm going to do for 2A if I can even get there. Jobmine has also been shit. I fucked up every interview and I know theres continuous but I'm probably not going to get anything there either. 

Socially I've been a mess as well. All my friends went to different university's and when I came here I was excited to meet new people. But whenever I talked to people it seemed that they weren't interested in talking with me and now I've ended up friendless here. The people I thought I was friends with turned out to hate me which hasn't made me feel any better. My anxiety has gone to shit because of all of this and now whenever I meet someone new I just fuck it all up. I've also found myself giving up lately. I've been skipping classes and missing quizzes that count towards my grade. I realize that I need to get my shit together but I've been struggling to nevertheless. I tried going in for help but that turned out to be useless. I just don't know what to do anymore and I just feel tired of this already.
